# Number-Guesser

Build a neural network and test its accuracy!

This program uses TensorFlow to train the neural network and uses PyGame to allow users to hand-draw a digit. It will try to predict which digit it is, and although it has a 99% accuracy with the training data, it has a more difficult time predicting user inputs, as drawings can highly vary from the data pulled from the MNIST dataset.

### Before Using

- Make sure you have Python 3.5 - 3.8 (TensorFlow does not work on other versions)
